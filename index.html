			<p class= "aboutme">
				I started coding amateurishly in 2017 before completing a coding BootCamp at Case Western Reserve University later that year. I grew up in a rural part of Akron, Ohio known as Portage Lakes, but I currently reside in Cleveland's Tremont neighborhood where I enjoy the local restaurants and bars. I also have a garden there that keeps me busy. Other hobbies include brewing beer, following the Detroit Red Wings and cooking all kinds of cuisine.
			</p>

			<p class="aboutme">
				My previous lines of work that led me to coding are varied including; forge worker, line cook, cobbler and Zamboni driver.  After stumbling around for longer than I'd like to admit, I found my calling in programming and haven't looked back since.
